# To-Do-App
To Do Web Application that uses "Web Browser Storage" to manage and store the Tasks created, that means, when you "Refresh" or "Close" the page/browser and load it again the Data will not be lost. Moreover, there are two different themes to choose from, "Light Mode" and "Dark Mode" which by default is set to "Light Mode" and once you choose a theme it stays unless you change it again, and by "Stays" we mean along with the Tasks, the "Theme" also is saved in the "Web Storage". There is Completed Tasks Data which is stored in the slider menu which we can access by clicking on the Hamburger icon on Top Left Side. We can remove the Tasks which are done, by clicking on them. Also, if we want to Reset the Tasks and Delete all the Tasks from storage, we can Click the "Reset" button on the slider menu.
